# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-09)

**Core value:** Given a Fabric warehouse and a key prefix, automatically produce a correct, deployable TMDL semantic model with proper dimension/fact classification and star-schema relationships.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Domain Types & Core Utilities

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Domain Types & Core Utilities)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Branch: gsd/phase-02-domain-types-core-utilities
Last activity: 2026-02-09 -- Phase 2 Plan 2 complete (core utility functions)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 37.5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6.3 min
- Total execution time: 0.31 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 268s | 268s |
| 02 | 2 | 670s | 335s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (268s), 02-01 (261s), 02-02 (409s)
- Trend: Phase 2 plans ~5.6 min/plan avg

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 32 requirements; depth=quick but project complexity warrants 8 phases (natural delivery boundaries)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is build system first (greenfield project, no source code yet)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6 and 7 can execute in parallel (both depend on Phase 5, independent of each other)
- [Settings]: Git branching strategy set to per-phase (gsd/phase-{N}-{slug})
- [01-01]: Use hatchling instead of setuptools for modern build backend with native VCS versioning
- [01-01]: Install dev tools separately rather than as optional-dependencies to keep build-system.requires minimal
- [01-01]: Ignore all ruff rules for auto-generated _version.py (uses deprecated typing syntax)
- [01-01]: Exclude .references, .claude, .planning from pre-commit hooks (reference materials, not source code)
- [02-plan]: All phase work (research, plans, code) must be committed on phase branch, never main
- [02-plan]: Version tags (v0.1.0 etc.) created only at milestone completion, not per-phase
- [02-01]: Use frozen=True, slots=True for all domain dataclasses (memory efficiency, immutability, hashability)
- [02-01]: TmdlDataType enum values match TMDL spec exactly (int64, double, boolean, string, dateTime, decimal, binary)
- [02-01]: Type mapping function normalizes input (lowercase, strip) for case-insensitive matching
- [02-01]: ValueError with helpful message listing all supported types for unsupported SQL types
- [02-02]: Use NamedTuple TmdlIndentationError instead of exception for composability in validation pipelines
- [02-02]: Preserve object_name case in UUID generation (source systems may be case-sensitive)
- [02-02]: Tab-only indentation validation (TMDL spec requires tabs, spaces are always wrong)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: TMDL Python examples are sparse (most tooling is .NET-based); may need extra validation in Phase 5
- [Research]: Role-playing dimension automation patterns have limited public documentation; Phase 4 may need deeper research
- [Research]: Fabric REST API connection binding for cross-environment deployment needs practical validation in Phase 7
