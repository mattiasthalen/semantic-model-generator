# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-09)

**Core value:** Given a Fabric warehouse and a key prefix, automatically produce a correct, deployable TMDL semantic model with proper dimension/fact classification and star-schema relationships.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Project Foundation & Build System

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Project Foundation & Build System)
Plan: 0 of 1 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-09 -- Roadmap created with 8 phases covering 32 requirements

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 32 requirements; depth=quick but project complexity warrants 8 phases (natural delivery boundaries)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is build system first (greenfield project, no source code yet)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6 and 7 can execute in parallel (both depend on Phase 5, independent of each other)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: TMDL Python examples are sparse (most tooling is .NET-based); may need extra validation in Phase 5
- [Research]: Role-playing dimension automation patterns have limited public documentation; Phase 4 may need deeper research
- [Research]: Fabric REST API connection binding for cross-environment deployment needs practical validation in Phase 7
